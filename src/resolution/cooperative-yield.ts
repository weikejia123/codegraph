/**
 * Cooperative yielding for long synchronous resolution spans.
 *
 * Reference resolution and callback-edge synthesis run on the indexer's MAIN
 * thread — unlike parsing, which is off-thread in the parse worker. The #850
 * liveness watchdog (armed on `index`/`init` since #999) SIGKILLs the process
 * when that thread doesn't turn its event loop for the timeout window (default
 * 60s), because its heartbeat is a `setInterval` on that same thread. On a large
 * repo, resolving refs + synthesizing dynamic-dispatch edges legitimately runs
 * for minutes, so a span that never yields starves the heartbeat and the
 * watchdog kills a VALID, in-progress index — the exact symptom of #1091 (the
 * progress bar freezes at wherever it last rendered — 88% / 100% — then the
 * process is killed).
 *
 * `createYielder` returns a `maybeYield()` that yields (via `setImmediate`) only
 * once more than `budgetMs` of wall-clock has elapsed since the last yield, so
 * fast repos pay essentially nothing while slow ones give the heartbeat a
 * regular window to fire. Call it at natural boundaries in a long loop (between
 * batches, between synthesis passes).
 *
 * This does NOT weaken the watchdog. A genuinely wedged loop — an infinite or
 * non-terminating span, the case the watchdog exists to catch — never reaches a
 * yield point, so the heartbeat still stops and the SIGKILL still fires. We only
 * stop killing work that is demonstrably making progress.

/**
 * Yield when more than `budgetMs` of wall-clock has passed since the last

 * hot loop can skip the await entirely — `await`ing an async no-op costs a
 * promise allocation + microtask hop, which at hundreds of thousands of calls
 * per index is real time. Callers may either `await maybeYield()` (works for

 *   `const y = maybeYield(); if (y) await y;`
