/**
 * Main-thread liveness watchdog — belt-and-suspenders for #850.
 *
 * The #850 fix removes the one *known* trigger (the uncaught-exception handler
 * no longer formats a raw Error's `.stack`). But ANY synchronous, non-yielding
 * loop on the main thread — a future V8 stack-format pathology, a runaway
 * regex, an accidental `while (true)` — wedges the event loop, and from JS you
 * cannot interrupt it: timers, signal handlers, and the PPID watchdog all run
 * *on* that blocked loop, so the process pins a core forever with no
 * self-recovery (the exact unrecoverable state #850 reported).
 *
 * **Why a separate PROCESS, not a worker thread.** A worker thread was the
 * obvious first choice and it works in a toy process — but it was validated to
 * FAIL in the real daemon (#850 live test). V8 isolates in one process
 * coordinate on global safepoints, so when one thread requests a GC every other
 * thread must reach a safepoint before it can proceed. A main thread wedged in
 * a tight, non-allocating loop never reaches one, which strands the watchdog
 * worker on its very next allocation/safepoint check — and the #850 hot loop
 * (`SourcePositionTableIterator::Advance`, a non-allocating C++ table walk) is
 * exactly that shape. A child process shares no isolate and no heap with the
 * parent, so the wedge cannot touch it; it kills via the kernel, which honours
 * SIGKILL regardless of what the parent's threads are doing.
 *
 * **How.** The parent writes a heartbeat byte to the child's stdin every
 * `checkMs` from a timer — firing at all means the event loop is turning. The
 * child resets a kill-timer on each byte; if none arrives for `timeoutMs` it
 * `SIGKILL`s the parent so a fresh daemon starts on the next connection. When
 * the parent exits normally the pipe closes and the child exits too (no
 * orphan).
 *
 * **Won't fire on real work.** Heavy parsing runs in the parse worker
 * (off-thread) and the daemon's indexing shells out to a child process, so the
 * daemon's main thread only ever does fast, bounded work. The default timeout
 * is ~300× the 5h #850 wedge shorter, yet far longer than any legitimate
 * main-thread block. Opt out with `CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCHDOG=1`; tune with
 * `CODEGRAPH_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_MS`.
 *
 * **Disk-progress deferral (`progressPaths`).** The CLI `index`/`init` path is
 * different: it runs the SQLite store on this thread, and one long synchronous
 * statement on severely degraded storage can block the loop past the timeout
 * with the process perfectly healthy (#1231: killed a valid index on a
 * 150-IOPS disk). Heartbeat silence alone cannot tell that apart from a wedge —
 * but the disk can: a wedged CPU loop makes no forward progress on the DB
 * files, while a slow store advances them. When the caller supplies
 * `progressPaths` (the SQLite DB + `-wal`), the child checks them at each
 * silent timeout: size/mtime advanced ⇒ defer the kill and keep watching;
 * unchanged ⇒ kill as before. Deferral is bounded by a hard cap
 * (`PROGRESS_CAP_MULTIPLIER` × timeout) of continuous silence, so a wedge
 * coinciding with unrelated file activity — or I/O hung beyond all reason —
 * still dies. A true wedge with no disk progress dies at the base timeout,
 * exactly as before.
