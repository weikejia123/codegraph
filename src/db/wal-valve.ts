/**
 * WAL checkpoint valve — bounds WAL growth while auto-checkpointing is
 * deferred during a bulk index (#1231).
 *
 * Why deferral: SQLite's default `wal_autocheckpoint` (1000 pages) re-writes
 * hot B-tree/FTS pages into the main DB file over and over during a bulk
 * index — measured at ~95% of ALL disk I/O, and the difference between 45s
 * and 19+ minutes on HDD-class storage (150 random IOPS). Deferring
 * checkpoints turns the store into pure sequential WAL appends; each backfill
 * pass writes distinct pages once, in page order (≈ sequential).
 *
 * Why a valve: unbounded deferral is its own failure mode, both measured in
 * the #1231 repro. The WAL duplicates hot pages per COMMIT, so it grows far
 * faster than the DB (5.9GB WAL for a ~340MB DB on a 3.3k-file index) —
 * filling the disk, and poisoning every subsequent read that must page
 * through it (the first resolution-phase read blocked the main thread >60s
 * and the #850 liveness watchdog killed the healthy index). The valve
 * watches WAL growth on a timer and, past a soft threshold, backfills with
 * `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(PASSIVE)` on a worker-thread connection — PASSIVE
 * never blocks the writer, and off-thread means the main thread (and the
 * watchdog heartbeat) keep turning regardless of how long a backfill takes.
 *
 * The load-bearing subtlety: a WAL file's SIZE never shrinks. After a full
 * backfill, the writer's next commit RESTARTS the WAL from the top and the
 * frames recycle inside the same file — so raw size says nothing about the
 * un-backfilled backlog, and a size-triggered valve degenerates into firing
 * (and pausing the writer) forever once the file passes its threshold
 * (measured: guava crawled at ~9min per 160 files). Instead the valve
 * tracks `sizeAtLastFullBackfill` — refreshed whenever a checkpoint reports
 * `log === checkpointed` (everything backfilled) — and triggers on GROWTH
 * beyond that baseline, which only happens when genuinely un-backfilled
 * frames push past the file's high-water mark.
 *
 * Backpressure: if the writer outruns the checkpointer past a hard cap of
 * growth (2× soft), {@link backpressure} pauses the writer (at a safe,
 * between-transactions boundary) until a FULL backfill lands. One in-flight
 * pass is not enough: on a disk saturated by the writer, every concurrent
 * PASSIVE pass is already stale by the time it finishes (the writer appended
 * past its snapshot), so neither SQLite's WAL wrap nor the baseline ever
 * trigger and the WAL grows without bound (measured: 5.9GB on guava at 150
 * IOPS, then a >60s read stall and a watchdog kill). With the writer parked,
 * the next pass covers everything, the WAL wraps on the following commit,
 * and the pause is the disk's honest catch-up cost — the correct terminal
 * mode when hardware genuinely can't keep up with the append rate.
